Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how the A-click Chrome Extension ("the extension") handles user data.

1. Data Collection
The extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, browsing data, or user-generated content.

2. Data Usage
The extension operates entirely on the user’s local device. All actions, including identifying and clicking buttons on a webpage, are performed locally within the browser and are not transmitted to any external servers.

3. Third-Party Services
The extension does not use any third-party analytics, tracking tools, advertising services, or external APIs.

4. Permissions
The extension requires certain permissions (such as activeTab, scripting, and contextMenus) solely to perform its core functionality. These permissions are used only when the user explicitly triggers the extension and are not used for background data collection.

5. Data Sharing
No data is shared with third parties under any circumstances.

6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected on this page.

7. Contact
