# A-click
Chrome extension to automatically select all "Yes" options on web pages with one click. Features smart detection, iframe support, and visual feedback.

I created a demo GIF (Demo for A_click.gif) to demonstrate the core functionality of this extension, showing how it automatically locates and clicks the target button on a webpage when triggered by the user.

The extension has also been published on the Chrome Web Store, allowing users to install and use it directly from the official Chrome extension marketplace.
